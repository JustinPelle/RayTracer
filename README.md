# RayTracer

## Description
This code was written in the graphics course for my bachelor’s degree, in which we had to make a (whitted-style) ray-tracer from near scratch. Even though it was advised to be a group-assignment, I was up for a challenge myself, and received a very passing grade for my hand-in.

## Dependencies
Is build using Dotnet 4.6.1 developer pack and OpenTk 3.3.1. 

## Execution
The raytracer can be run using the included .exe executable.

## Notes
-	Even though the graphics part of the code is okay w.r.t. the assignment’s specification; the user interaction and screen-updating is slow and lacking (luckily this was not a crucial part of the assignment).
